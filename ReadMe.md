Introduction:

This lab will present the difference between scripting languages such as: #c and Python.

As we already know python is very comfort language but the trade of is the complexity in

compare to #c.

My task is to create 3 machines lets call them A,B,C and to send from A 1M Syn to C and

measure the time to send each packet ICMP(Ping)/Syn.

Simultaneously machine B send pings to C for checking the respond.

Results:

10.0.2.6

View of Machine A: Syn Flood

#C

**Buttom Line:** As we can

see #C as Scripting

language is more

efficient. Hence the trade

of is between efficiency

and comfort.
